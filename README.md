This is a programming challenge where I have to design a battery store.

This was tested on node v18.12.0 and npm v9.7.1

To install, git clone this repo and run 
```
npm install
```

Requirements: 
- The user should be able to enter the number of each device they want, and your
UI should show the price, land dimension required and the sites energy density
- Assume that for every 4 industrial batteries bought 1 transformer is needed.
- The UI should also have an autogenerated layout showing an arrangement of
batteries based on the userâ€™s configuration
- The site layouts should not exceed 100ft in width
- If this project requires many things to work, ensure the whole app is runnable
with one command.
- Make sure the front-end service runs on http://localhost:8000 when hosted
locally

Stack: 
- React
- Typescript
- Node

Important libraries I used:
- Material UI
- react-dnd
